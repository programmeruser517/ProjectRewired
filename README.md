# ProjectRewired

"Rewired", currently an app concept (that's what the files here are), is a transformative mobile app designed to shift users from a passive mindset to an active, experiential one. Unlike conventional approaches or mindsets that focus solely on end results, this app empowers individuals to seek and embrace experiences as the key to personal and professional growth. With "Rewired," users can explore diverse experiential pathways and gain insights from others who have successfully ventured beyond traditional boundaries. Leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, the app would not only identify fields of interest for experiential exploration, but also generate small, achievable goals tailored to each user's desired field of experiential learning. Whether pursuing a passion, building skills, or broadening horizons, "Rewired" should guide users on a journey of intentional and meaningful experiences, fostering a mindset that thrives on the richness of the learning process itself.

Please help make this project a reality and feel free to code this to anyone's heart's content.
